The team rocket was originaly formed for  the needs of the  project 2 during our remote trainee session at the Wild Code School.
the team is composed of <b> Marie-Claire NIKOBAOZE</b>, <b>Corentin SAUCY</b>, <b>Christian LIM</b> , <b>Kevin LAVIGNE</b>, <b>Alexandre GENIN</b>.
Our goal was to deliver a React APP,  based on API fetchings,  Javascript Knowledges,  and  CSS mastering.


We decided to base our project around Pokemon by creating a Pokedex of the first generation .
This pokedex comes from the API  Pok√©api  :
https://pokeapi.co/

we wanna adress our special thanks  to the persons and community who are maintaining this API  open-sourced and available for free .
